Every agent must read this file before editing or answering.

**Date:** 2026-09-21 (Monday)
**Session:** Mailbox change form — theme classes, not hardcoded colors
**Branch:** main

## Done
- Webhook mailbox change form uses Jazzmin/Bootstrap theme classes
  (`card card-outline card-primary`, `alert alert-secondary`, `text-body`)
  so THEMES light/dark controls contrast everywhere.
- Removed hardcoded orange/white and forced light-field colors.

## Next
Rebuild → toggle theme; confirm banner + Published records stay readable.
Then **#2** async pull API.
